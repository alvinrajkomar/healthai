# Health AI Template

A template for analysis and evaluation of models in the health realm

## Project Overview

(Provide a more detailed overview of what kind of projects this template is intended for. What are the main goals? What technologies are primarily used?)

This template helps ensure consistency and includes boilerplate for common tasks such as data processing, analysis, and reporting.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key directories and files in this template:

├── data/
│   ├── interim/        # Intermediate data that has been transformed.
│   ├── processed/      # Final, canonical data sets for analysis.
│   └── raw/            # Original, immutable data.
├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for exploration, experimentation, and analysis.
├── reports/            # Generated reports, visualizations, and summaries.
├── src/                # Source code for data processing, analysis, utility functions, etc.
├── .gitignore          # Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
├── README.md           # This file: provides an overview and instructions for the project.
├── requirements.txt    # Lists the Python project dependencies.
└── sample.env          # Example environment variables file.

**Directory Descriptions:**

* **`data/`**: Contains all project-related data, organized by processing stage.
    * **`data/raw/`**: Store your original, immutable data here. Treat this as read-only.
    * **`data/interim/`**: For intermediate data created during your data processing pipeline. These files can often be recreated from raw data and processing scripts.
    * **`data/processed/`**: Stores the final, cleaned, and processed data that is ready for analysis, modeling, or reporting.
* **`notebooks/`**: For Jupyter notebooks. Ideal for exploratory data analysis (EDA), prototyping models, and interactive analyses.
* **`reports/`**: Store final outputs here, such as generated PDF reports, HTML files, or key figures and visualizations for presentations.
* **`src/`**: Contains all Python scripts and modules. This can include:
    * Data ingestion and processing scripts.
    * Analysis scripts.
    * Utility functions.
    * Code for generating reports or visualizations.
* **`.gitignore`**: A standard Git file that tells Git which files or directories to ignore when committing code (e.g., `*.pyc`, `__pycache__`, `.env`, `data/raw/*` if raw data is too large or sensitive, etc.).
* **`README.md`**: You are here! This file should be updated to be specific to each project created from this template.
* **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python packages required to run the project. Use this file to install dependencies.
* **`sample.env`**: A template for your environment variables. Copy this to a `.env` file and fill in your actual credentials and configurations. **The `.env` file itself should be in your `.gitignore` and never committed to the repository.**

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up a new project based on this template.

### Prerequisites

* Python (version X.X or higher recommended, e.g., Python 3.9+)
* pip (Python package installer)
* Virtualenv (or Conda, or your preferred environment manager)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you're starting a new project from this template, you would typically "Use this template" on GitHub, then clone your new repository):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-new-project-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-new-project-name.git)
    cd your-new-project-name
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * Using `venv`:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    * Using `conda`:
        ```bash
        conda create -n myenv python=3.9
        conda activate myenv
        ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Set up environment variables:**
    * Copy the sample environment file:
        ```bash
        cp sample.env .env
        ```
    * Edit the `.env` file with your specific configurations, API keys, database credentials, etc. **Do not commit the `.env` file to Git.**

## Usage

(This section should be customized based on the typical project.)

* **Running data pipelines:**
    ```bash
    python src/data_processing/main_pipeline.py
    ```
* **Running analyses:**
    Scripts in `src/analysis/` can be executed directly, or functions from these modules can be imported into notebooks.
* **Working with notebooks:**
    Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    Then navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to open and run your notebooks.
